## Mockup News Platform

This project is a mockup news platform inspired by local news outlet [Južne Vesti](https://www.juznevesti.com/).

To set up the project in local environment clone the repository and follow typical steps for setting up a Laravel project. [For general instructions check here](https://devmarketer.io/learn/setup-laravel-project-cloned-github-com/).

In order to get a proper path for sample images, create folder **public** in *storage/app* and copy the folder **images** from *storage/images* to *storage/app/public*.

After that, run `php artisan storage:link` command in the terminal.

Database migration and seeding will generate categories, towns, fake news articles, comments and users. Also, an admin user will be generated. To login as admin use admin@mail.com and password *password!*.

Users can post, delete and edit their own comments. Admin can create, edit and delete all articles and comments.
